# Webscraper

### Overview

This project features a simple webscraper, which can scrape webpages and extract information like contact details and a AI generated summary.


### Description

A simple (recursive) web crawler that can summarize a websites text (e.g. p tags) and can extract contact information (based on a simple algorithm).
The webcrawler is a console application, allowing users to input an URL and add the scraping mode (contact, etc..). The application will then scrape the page and print the results in the console (e.g. phone numbers, email, social media accounts). Additionally, it provides access to the openai api, enabling smart website summaries
